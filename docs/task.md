# Python Assignment: Wikipedia API

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Python-based API that interacts with Wikipedia to perform specific text analysis tasks. 
The API should consist of two primary endpoints designed to analyze and store the frequency of words in Wikipedia articles based on user queries.

## Requirements

### Endpoints

#### Word Frequency Analysis Endpoint

Functionality: This endpoint should accept two parameters: topic (a string representing the subject of a Wikipedia article) and n (an integer specifying the number of top frequent words to return).
Process: Upon receiving a request, the API should fetch the text of the Wikipedia article corresponding to the provided topic, analyze the text to determine the frequency of each word, and then return the top n most frequent words in a structured format.

#### Search History Endpoint

Functionality: This endpoint will list the past search results, including the topics searched and the corresponding top frequent words returned by the API.
Details: The response should be well-formatted, providing clear insight into past searches and their outcomes.

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is required, detailing endpoint usage, setup instructions, and examples of requests and responses.
Include comments in the code to explain the functionality and logic applied.

### Testing
Implement unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of your API endpoints.
Cover a range of scenarios, including both typical use cases and edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing.
